// Array: Concat
// Replicate JavaScript’s concat(). Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays. Return a new
// array containing the first array’s elements, followed by the second array’s elements. Do not alter the
// original arrays. Ex.: arrConcat( ['a','b'], [1,2] ) should return new array ['a','b',1,2].

function concat()


console.log()


// Array: Min to Front
// Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, shifting backward any
// elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5],
// change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it. As always, do this without using built-in functions.




// BONUS:
// Array: Shuffle
// In JavaScript, the Array object has numerous useful methods. It does not, however, contain a method
// that will randomize the order of an array’s elements. Let’s create shuffle(arr), to efficiently shuffle a
// given array’s values. Work in-place, naturally. Do you need to return anything from your function?
